- consider seperating big logic files to more abstracted files for better organization

Style and Decoration:
- use line of "=" to seperate distict logic areas 
- use line of "-" to seperate sections of the same logic area

- follow my comments style, adding ? mark to make some lines blue. add the comments to explain the main idea of a block of code
